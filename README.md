A Card Game, capturing the essence of the mario jump 'n run games

MarioCards is a competitive card game for 2 to 5 players.


# Goal of the Game

A player of Mario Cards can choose to pursue one of three paths to victory. If one of those victory conditions are met by one player, the **round of play** will be completed and the game ends. Any player that has reached at least one victory condition at this time, wins the game.

* *Lone Survivor* - As soon as only one player is left with at least one life, that player wins.
* *Runthrough* - As soon as a player has filled up his **level completion counter**, the game ends and that player wins at the end of the **last round**.
* *Coin Collector* - When a player has gathered at least 10 coins, the game ends and that player wins at the end of the last round.

Shuffle the **event cards** and place then on the center of the table, face down. Hand out 7 cards to every player from that deck. If a player does not get a single **movement card** this way, he may redraw and put his initial cards on the discard pile.
